        <p class="mb-4">
          In addition to submitting your primary argument, you have the option
          to engage with a challenge. This challenge is designed to help you
          identify any logical inconsistencies, unclear points, or areas where
          your argument may be improved.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Responding to the challenge will prompt a secondary evaluation and may
          earn additional XP. The challenge feature is optional, you can also
          move on to another question.

      <!-- How XP is Calculated Section -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How XP is Calculated</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Your performance is rewarded with XP, which help you level up and
          track your progress. XP is only awarded when your claim and supporting
          argument meet a minimum relevance threshold ({{ relevance_threshold
          }}/10).
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Once your response passes this relevance check, the XP is calculated
          based on six key dimensions: Relevance, Logical Structure, Clarity,
          Depth, Objectivity, and Creativity. The average score from these
          criteria (each rated on a scale from 1 to 10) is multiplied by 10 to
          determine the total XP earned.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          For example, if your performance in those six dimensions averages out
          to 6 out of 10, you would receive 60 XP for that response.
