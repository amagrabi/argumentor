          Developing strong reasoning skills is about more than just defending a
          position: it's about constructing a coherent, well-supported argument.
          The techniques below offer actionable steps to refine your
          argumentation and critical thinking.

          The SEEC Framework: Build Your Argument Step-by-Step
        </h3>
        <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>State:</strong> Clearly articulate your main claim. Ask
            yourself, "What exactly am I trying to prove?" Keep your statement
            concise and debatable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Explain:</strong> Detail your thought process by outlining
            the rationale behind your claim. Describe the assumptions and
            logical steps that lead you to your conclusion.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Evidence:</strong> Back up your reasoning with solid data,
            reputable sources, or concrete examples. Look for statistics, case
            studies, or expert opinions that lend credibility to your argument.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Summarize your argument by tying your
            evidence back to your claim. Reiterate how your data supports your
            position and address any potential counterarguments.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Breaking your argument into these steps makes it easier to identify
          gaps in your reasoning and refine each part systematically.

      <!-- Evidence-Based Reasoning Section -->
      <section class="mb-8">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">
          Embrace Evidence-Based Reasoning
        </h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Always seek out credible information and avoid relying solely on
          assumptions. Validate your data and be open to updating your views
          when confronted with new evidence. This approach not only strengthens
          your argument but also enhances its persuasiveness.

      <!-- Recognizing Cognitive Biases Section -->
      <section class="mb-8">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">
          Identify and Address Cognitive Biases
        </h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Cognitive biases—such as confirmation bias or the halo effect—can
          distort our thinking without our awareness. Actively question your
          assumptions and seek out perspectives that challenge your views in
          order to build a more robust and balanced argument.
