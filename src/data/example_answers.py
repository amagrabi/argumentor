QUESTION_TEXT = """In decision-making, is relying on the bandwagon effect a justifiable strategy when evidence is scarce, or is it a flawed approach that should be avoided at all costs?"""
CLAIM = """Following the bandwagon effect is a justifiable strategy when evidence is scarce."""
ARGUMENT = """When evidence is scarce, you do not have a lot of reliable options to guide decision-making. Without evidence, you cannot put confidence in the truthfulness of any assumptions. And without a solid foundation, you cannot construct solid arguments. So in a situation when you have no evidence, it would be best to take more time and search evidence. But if you do not have that time and need to make a decision now, it can be better to follow the majority, because it has a higher likelihood of success."""
