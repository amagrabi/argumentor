QUESTION_TEXT = """In decision-making, is relying on the bandwagon effect a justifiable strategy when evidence is scarce, or is it a flawed approach that should be avoided at all costs?"""
CLAIM = """Following the bandwagon effect is a justifiable strategy when evidence is scarce."""
ARGUMENT = """When evidence is scarce, you do not have a lot of reliable options to guide decision-making. Without evidence, you cannot put confidence in the truthfulness of any assumptions. And without a solid foundation, you cannot construct solid arguments. So in a situation when you have no evidence, it would be best to take more time and search evidence. But if you do not have that time and need to make a decision now, it can be better to follow the majority, because it has a higher likelihood of success."""

ARGUMENT = """AI has demonstrated super-human intelligence on many domains already. If that is the case, then AI is capable of making better or equal decisions than humans.

ARGUMENT = """Free decisions are decisions that are aligned with and a consequence of our internal beliefs and goals. All our internal beliefs and goals are determined by biology/physics, because they are determined by our brain. Therefore, these influence are not "bad", but actually a requirement for free will. The important part is that these influences result from cognitive processes that are aligned with our conscious beliefs and goals, instead of subconscious influences that go against them."""
